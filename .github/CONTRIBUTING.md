## How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, as this means you're looking to improve on the project and any help is more than appreciated.

#### Found a bug?

* If the bug wasn't already reported by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/digitalocean/supabase-on-do/issues), [open a new one](https://github.com/digitalocean/supabase-on-do/issues/new).
    * Currently we don't have a template for reporting bugs so try to be as specific as possible with the issue at hand (log outputs, setup, env variables with secrets obfuscated etc.).

#### Have a fix or improvement?

* First off - AWESOME!!!
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the appropriate label
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

_N.B._ Please be aware that this is a curated example of self hosting Supabase on DigitalOcean with the use of SendGrid. Therefore specific uses cases might be rejected. This does not mean that you shouldn't open the Issue/PR if needed (rather you ask than keep questioning). Also even if the Issue/PR are rejected, there is a record of the discussion which might help someone else in the future.

#### Terraform formatting

If you do create changes within the terraform code please run the `terraform fmt` command or install the [pre-commit hooks](../terraform/README.md#hooks) before submitting the PR to ensure formatting is kept.

#### Do you have further questions?

Don't hesitate to reach out to @timothymamo or anyone within the DigitalOcean developer advocacy team.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
